/**
 A YYImage object is a high-level way to display animated image data.
 
 @discussion It is a fully compatible `UIImage` subclass. It extends the UIImage
 to support animated WebP, APNG and GIF format image data decoding. It also 
 support NSCoding protocol to archive and unarchive multi-frame image data.
 
 If the image is created from multi-frame image data, and you want to play the 
 animation, try replace UIImageView with `YYAnimatedImageView`.
 
 Sample Code:
 
     
     YYImage *image = [YYImage imageNamed:@"animation.webp"];
     YYAnimatedImageView *imageView = [YYAnimatedImageView alloc] initWithImage:image];
     [view addSubView:imageView];
